# Testing login and signup functionality on https://archive.org/

#### This project contains 5 tests where I am checking login and signup functionality. Test can be run by testNG run and from XML file.

#### I need to notice that I deleted my mail from project and if you want to run project you will need to add your email and password in file "Constants".

### Also i am using linux and have chrome version 94, so if you use different OS or chrome version you will be need to add your chrome driver.

First test: is to login with valid email and password.

Second test: is to login with invalid email and password by using Excell and data providers.

Third test: was successful registration on Internet Archive.

Fourth test: was to register new user with invalid parameters.

All tests can be run from testNG run, also it can be run from Xml file. For running project you need installed SDK 11 on your machine.

I used POM pattern, but I need to tell that I wasn't make this framework.
